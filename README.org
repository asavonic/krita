* Status
Build is ok; passed all existing tests.
Tested on Nvidia GTX 1070 on Linux.

Performance is good (up to 27x speedup) on large tiles, but poor on
small tiles.

* Algorithms
- [X] CompositeOpAlphaDarken32: implemented, performance: poor
- [ ] CompositeOpAlphaDarken128
- [ ] CompositeOpOver32
- [ ] CompositeOpOver128

* Current problems
- Tile size is too small ::
     Average working area of a composite function is 64x64 pixels
     (16KB), which means that runtime overhead of memory transfer b/w
     a host and a device is significant.

- Need more testing ::
     Unit tests for OpenCL components, more tests for composite ops.

* Next steps
- Optimize CompositeOpAlphaDarken32 for small tiles
  - [ ] Pre-allocate pinned memory
  - [ ] Allocate tiles in GPU memory and keep it consistent with CPU.

- Run on Intel OpenCL for CPU and GPU.
